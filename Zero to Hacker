As part of cybersecurity, it is necessary to know how to manage operating systems, the most popular in the hacking niche is Kali and Parrot Linux, however other distributions will also help us. The most important thing is to know how to move on the console. That's why below I bring you the list of the most basic and most used commands, in order for you to learn how to move in the terminal. You don't need to memorize them, you'll eventually use them instinctively. 

cd Move between folders, you can pass the full path of the folder to it or use, to return to the previous folder you can type cd .. or cd ~/ to go to the user's main directory

ls Show the files in the directory you're in, the -la parameter will show us hidden files and the -l parameter shows you the permissions of each file

cat Read the contents of a file

nano Text editor to edit the content of a file, you can also use mousepad in the case of Kali to have a more comfortable editor outside the terminal

mkdir foldername Create a folder

rm -r foldername Delete folder regardless of whether it has content or not

sudo su Become an administrator user (Ask for password)

mv /path File allows us to move from directories, files, folders, etc.

cp Copy files or directories

clear Cleans the console

pwd Show the directory you're in

control + L Clean Clean the console without deleting what you are typing

up arrow Allows you to use previous command without having to type it

down arrow Allows you to clear what you are typing

arrow to the right -->  It allows you to autocomplete what you are typing according to the text predictor

arrow to the left <--   Allows you to move between the written text to modify it

--version Allows you to see the version of the program you want to use for example (git --version)

tab key Allows you to fill in the name of files, directories or commands

control shift c Allows you to copy what you select

control shift v Allows you to paste the paper holder

control c Terminate a process that is running

control o Save file

control x Exit file

control w Search keyword

chmod Allows you to change permissions, execution, reading, editing. for example (chmod +x script.sh) would give you permission to execute a script without execution permission”

./ Allows you to run a file, for example (. /script.sh) allows you to execute the script that we previously gave it execution permission”

echo It allows you to print text on the screen, you can pass parameters such as echo “hello world” and it shows us a hello world on the screen or echo $PATH to show a directory

grep Allows you to search for a keyword (known as “piping”), for example cat documento.txt | grep “Word to search for”

git clone “URL” allows you to clone a GitHub repository to install tools

; With semicolons you can separate commands, this allows you to do multiple commands on a single line

&& It allows you to execute more than one command per line but the next one will only be executed if the first one is successful and there is no error

|| It allows you to execute one command or another, if the first one doesn't execute then execute the second

touch File.txt helps you create a file with the format you want, unlike nano it only creates the file, it doesn't allow you to edit it

-f The -f parameter allows you to force, meaning that it will not ask and will perform the action

-v Means verbose means that it will give us more detailed information about the result of a command

| xargs Allows you to add extra parameters to the result of a command

curl Makes an HTTP request to view source from a web site, you can add parameters to bring it as an output file such as curl -o "website_URL"
